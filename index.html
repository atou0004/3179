          confections which are made of chocolate. Not only that, when you first heard of chocolate, the first thing
          that pop into your mind would be a picture of sweet tasting candy bar. Little did you know that it was

          <p>The most important aspect of the Cacao Ratings is the flavour. Flavor diversity, balance,
            intensity, and purity are all taken into account. When considering flavour component, genetics, terroir,
            post-harvest
            techniques, processing, and storage can all be discussed. </p>

          <p>Texture related issues can also have an impact on the flavour, as texture has a significant impact on the
            overall experience.</p>

            <b>nutty</b> is the most common flavour in a dark chocolate bar.
